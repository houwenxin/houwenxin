### About

- ðŸ˜„ Hi there, thank you for passing by, this is Wenxin (Harold)!
- ðŸ‘¯ Check out my [homepage](https://houwx.net/) to learn more about me!

### Participated Softwares or Projects

- [NeuralSpeech](https://github.com/microsoft/NeuralSpeech): A research project in Microsoft Research Asia focusing on neural network based speech processing, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), text to speech (TTS), etc.
- [TorchSSL](https://github.com/TorchSSL/TorchSSL): An all-in-one toolkit based on PyTorch for **semi-supervised learning (SSL)**, containing code for 9 popular SSL algorithms to enable fair comparison and boost the development of SSL algorithms.
- [EasyEspnet](https://github.com/jindongwang/EasyEspnet): A wrapper for easier usage of [ESPnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet) that **helps you learn/write/run/debug** codes in a more friendly Python style.
- [DeepDA](https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning/tree/master/code/DeepDA): A lightweight, easy-to-extend, easy-to-learn and high-performance toolkit based on PyTorch for **domain adaptation (DA)** of deep neural networks.
- [spolacq](https://github.com/tttslab/spolacq): **Spoken Language Acquisition** From Conversation Based On Reinforcement Learning

### Personal Recommendations
- [ESPnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet): the best-ever all-in-one toolkit for **end-to-end speech processing**!
- [Transfer Learning](https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning): you can find all you need for **transfer learning** from it!

<!-- - ðŸ˜„ Hi there, this is Wenxin Hou. I am a final-year Master student at Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech).
- ðŸ”­ My research interest includes speech processing (speech recognition & synthesis, sound anomaly detection, spoken language acquisition), transfer learning and its applications in speech processing.
- ðŸŒ± I am also interested in NLP field, like representation learning, and neural machinie translation!
- ðŸ‘¯ I am open to collaboration, feel free to contact me via Email (ðŸ‘ˆ)!
- âš¡ Please check my [homepage](https://houwenxin.github.io) for my CV and latest update!
